HOW TO GET CONNECTION STRING FROM DATABASE SETTINGS PAGE
=========================================================

You're on the Database Settings page. Here's where to find connection details:

ON THE DATABASE SETTINGS PAGE:

1. Look for "Database password" section
   - You should see "Reset database password" button
   - This is your database password (if you set it)
   - If you don't know it, click "Reset database password" to create a new one

2. Scroll down or look for "Connection string" or "Connection info" section
   - It might be in a different tab or section
   - Look for tabs like: "URI", "JDBC", "Connection parameters"

3. OR look in the LEFT SIDEBAR under "Database" section:
   - Click "Settings" (you're already there)
   - But also check other sections like:
     - "Connection pooling" 
     - "Connection info"
     - "Connection string"

ALTERNATIVE: GET IT FROM PROJECT SETTINGS
------------------------------------------

1. In the LEFT SIDEBAR, look for "Project Settings" (not Database Settings)
2. Click "Project Settings" or "Settings" (gear icon)
3. Look for "Database" under Project Settings
4. That's where the connection string usually is

WHAT YOU NEED TO FIND:
----------------------
- Connection string (URI format)
- OR Connection parameters showing:
  * Host
  * Port  
  * Database
  * User
  * Password

IF YOU CAN'T FIND CONNECTION STRING:
------------------------------------
1. Look for "Connection pooling" in the sidebar
2. Or try: Settings → API → but look for database connection (not API keys)
3. Or use the "Reset database password" button to set a password you know

QUICK FIX - USE RESET PASSWORD:
-------------------------------
1. On Database Settings page, click "Reset database password"
2. Copy the new password
3. Use it in your .env file:
   DB_PASSWORD=the-new-password-you-just-created

Then your .env should work with:
DB_HOST=db.qmonmawebxzlbithvkli.supabase.co
DB_PORT=5432
DB_DATABASE=postgres
DB_USERNAME=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=your-new-password
