HOW TO FIND DATABASE CONNECTION IN SUPABASE
===========================================

You're currently looking at API KEYS section. Database connection is DIFFERENT!

STEP-BY-STEP:

1. In Supabase Dashboard, look at the LEFT SIDEBAR

2. Find "Settings" (gear icon) - click it

3. Under "Project Settings", you'll see:
   - API (where you are now - shows API keys)
   - Database ← CLICK THIS ONE!
   - Auth
   - Storage
   - etc.

4. Click "Database"

5. Scroll down to find "Connection string" section

6. You'll see tabs:
   - URI
   - JDBC
   - Connection parameters
   - etc.

7. Click "URI" tab

8. You'll see the connection string like:
   postgresql://postgres:[PASSWORD]@db.qmonmawebxzlbithvkli.supabase.co:5432/postgres

9. OR click "Connection parameters" tab to see:
   - Host
   - Port
   - Database name
   - User
   - Password

WHAT YOU NEED:
--------------
- Host: (from Connection parameters or extract from URI)
- Port: Usually 5432
- Database: postgres
- User: postgres
- Password: (from Connection parameters or extract from URI)

IF YOU CAN'T FIND IT:
--------------------
1. Make sure you're in Settings → Database (NOT Settings → API)
2. Scroll down - Connection string section is usually at the bottom
3. If still can't find, try: Settings → Database → Connection pooling

ALTERNATIVE: USE CONNECTION POOLING
-----------------------------------
If direct connection doesn't work:
1. Settings → Database → Connection pooling
2. Copy connection string from there
3. Use port 6543 instead of 5432
